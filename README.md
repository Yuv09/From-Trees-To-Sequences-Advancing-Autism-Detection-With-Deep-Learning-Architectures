# From-Trees-To-Sequences-Advancing-Autism-Detection-With-Deep-Learning-Architectures
The project implements and compares multiple models including Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, RNN, and LSTM to identify the most effective approach for ASD prediction. The system uses screening data to generate reliable early diagnostic insights.
